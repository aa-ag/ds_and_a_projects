## TIME COMPLEXITY

`O(n log n)`

## SPACE COMPLEXITY 

`O(n)`

## Design choices

Implementing merge sort with arrays (lists) passed all tests, in `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` space.

In future iterations, I read a StackOverflow thread where comments suggest a linked list implementation may improve space complexity: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10342890/merge-sort-time-and-space-complexity
