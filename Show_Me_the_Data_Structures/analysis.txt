*** Time Complexity Analysis ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For this project, you will answer the six questions laid out in the next sections. 
The questions cover a variety of topics related to the data structures you've learned in this course. 
You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, 
as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.
