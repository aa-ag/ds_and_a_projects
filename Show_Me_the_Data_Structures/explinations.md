# Explinations

A paragraph explaining desing choices for each problem solved. 

_instructions_: Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.

### problem_1.py

The most important design choice I made was to use `collections.OrderedDict()` for `cache`. This, would allow `LRU_Cache` to be efficient to insert to and to look up values in and at the same time, it would allow for values to be ordered, and therefore, keep tally of capacity.
